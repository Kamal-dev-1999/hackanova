 I'm about to show you what a half a million dollar experience looks like. I promise this is going to blow your mind. In this video, you will find out why it costs a quarter of a million dollars to simulate going to space. Why it costs 50,000 dollars to explore the depths of our oceans? Whoa! It's coming right out of every other experience we try to along the way. I am standing on top of the tallest building in the world! Oh my god! All the way down to the cheapest experience I can find. Writing a camel. How long can I ride this camel for a dollar? One dollar two minutes. Deal. That's a great one dollar experience. Yeah. Oh! Hold on tight. Wait, hold on tight, why? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh my god! I wanted to ride camels in Egypt, but they're way more than a dollar, so I'm going to throw the pyramids up and post. Yo! Yeah, it's beautiful. Dude, this is a workout. This day on the same day. I mean, I'm so high up in the sky. Now you know what it's like to be me and Chandler. Okay. Well, one dollar only got its two minutes, and that time is up. Let's go have dinner in the sky. For $10,000, you can go 3,000 feet in the sky, with a chef who uses this hot air balloon as her kitchen. You can see the shadow of the balloon over there in the field. Dude. This is a little higher than I expected, I'm not going to lie. But this isn't your everyday dinner at 3,000 feet in the air. This Michelin star chef uses the flame from the hot air balloon itself to literally cook the food for the meal she's preparing. Misabese. Oh, yo! That's our next course of food, bro. Now we're about to have fish that they cooked with the fire from the hot air balloon. Oh, thank you. Oh my god. Jimmy, this is amazing. Look how beautiful it is down there. Such an amazing view while we eat. This fish never dreamed of being this high up. If you got an extra 10 grand and want to impress a girl, I would recommend this. Every single one of these 10 gourmet courses was phenomenal, but I still had one question I needed to ask. As a Michelin star chef, what do you think of this fish towards bar? Very good in balance and what I like is the crunch and the chocolates. The fish towards now Michelin star brewed. The 10k experience was very beautiful. Amazing. Up next is the 50k experience. And Chiller Car will have no idea what I have in store for them. What do you think of the yacht? I think it's beautiful. Pretty? Yeah. Yeah. Do you think you have cost 50 grand for the day? No. Okay. So look over there. We're going to go on a submarine expedition. Oh my god. You guys ready to explore the four of the ocean? Yeah. Okay. Let's do this. Oh my god. What? We're not doing that. Let's head over. Okay. Come on. Let's go explore the floor of the ocean. Okay. This is awesome. Wow. I can already see fish. Look. We haven't even gone down yet. Look at the barricades. You guys want to scrape the floor of the ocean? We can. We can do anything. We have this entire submarine to ourselves and can explore whatever we want. Let's do everything. Except crash it. We are not allowed to do that. Okay. And to make sure we got the very best angles down here. We paid scuba divers to follow the submarine. Isn't it cool? Let's communicate with them. Shark behind. Everyone freak out. Okay. Start freaking out. Got it. And while we're underwater, Tariq and Nolan are also on a $50,000 safari in Africa. And we're going to see if we see more cool creatures down here than they do over there. Spoiler we will. This is gorgeous. All right. Let's go find the king of the jungle. We cannot leave Africa. Until we see a lion. Do you understand? I do understand. Why do you point at me like that? Go go go go go. Oh my god! Yo, it's pumpa. I was scared of you. Oh. I'm scared of you. I'm sorry. I shouldn't yell. I'm not supposed to yell. Zebra! I feel like Zebra is a taste pig. Like if I was a lion, I'd always go for a Zebra. They just look. Take what? All right. This is so worth $50,000. Yeah. This is so worth $50,000. Wait, Carl. What if instead of being a ship, that's a safari? We're taking this thing back up from you. Wow. Look how close we are to those rocks. Oh. Is it okay how close we are? Yeah, yeah, it's okay. All right. But we weren't the only ones getting up close in person. Zebra, where are you going? Hey buddy, wait. Don't go. Come back. Patrick, let's talk about the elephant in the room. Well, there's two right behind you. Oh, they are unnervingly close. They're very close. Oh, it's awfully close. It is coming towards us. He's got charged by an elk. John's just in his head. It's the coolest thing to do. Look at him. That thing is a unit. That's my dad. This is way cooler than a submarine. I really see this in a fish. Also, I heard a beating out of my chest right now. And that was the 50k experience. What we have coming up next is even better. This thing hails in comparison to the $250,000 zero gravity experience. This company will fly you up and then knows the treating a zero gravity environment inside the plane. The $250,000 experience starts now. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh, I can't stop floating. Go on. Oh, that was awesome. Oh my gosh. This is sick. On this next drop, we're going to race to the other side. Turn on zero gravity. Oh, wow. Two, one. Oh my god. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh my god. We made it. Oh, we made it. We won. Yes. Turns out racing without gravity doesn't work so well. But luckily, Carl had a better idea. I'm going to test out a leaf blower. All right, wait for it. Oh. He's spinning. Oh my god. We need that. We need that. Stop. Oh my god. And before we turn the gravity off again, we're going to try to make some of our Mr. V Slams swarms and zero gravity, ready? Yeah. Woo. No way. Let's try to make some. I created the coolest toys ever. All you have to do is pour water into the tube, shake it, and you'll find out which swarms you got. I'm going to squirt some water. Do some. Ow. I'll be getting the swarmed by these toys right now. This is as easy as I thought. But anyways, there's over 119 swarms You can find swarms in packs of 12, packs of five, and packs of two. Available at Walmart, Target, and Amazon in the United States, and everywhere around the world at your top toy retailer. It's my favorite toy. I'm weightless. These are the most exciting toys this holiday season, and they're flying off the shelf. Tomorrow, Ken. Oh, that's going to be cool. Hold on, no one catches. Do it here. OK. Body slam. I have no idea how the 500,000 all experience you got to top this. Well, let's go find out. And after going all around the entire world to film this video, we're at the 500,000 dollar experience. This is the craziest view of ever. Unlike any spectacle seen before in the history of mankind, my friends and I are about to see what half of million dollars can allow you to experience in the most luxurious, much-trapless in the entire world, the city of DuPai. They placed car from the desert, but created for pleasure. And at the end of this video, I'm going to become one of the few individuals in history to stand on top of the tallest building in the world. We went all out. It is going to blow your mind. Let's go have some fun. How are we here? So after we found our way off this 500 foot picture frame, we made our way over to this castle of a hotel. Whoa. Wow. This is insane. Water in our backyard. The first two floors of this hotel room are magnificent, but the coolest one by far is the third level that's completely underwater. Whoa. Oh, my God. Whoa. Welcome to Atlantis. We love you all, except for you, Carl. Sorry, man. He went into a thing with sharks just to make fun of me. For the record, there's over 80 sharks in this tank. And later in this experience, we're actually going to be swimming with them. And for the cherry on top to wrap all this up, come on, we're going to go sky-diving. No way. Yeah. Dude, falling from thousands of thousands of feet, yeah. Don't worry about that. Let's go race that one, Carl. Yeah. It would have been a better place to do so than at the Dubai Auto Drone, home to some of the fastest cars in the entire city. Just grab whatever car you want. Let's go race. All right. Let's go. And I called up some of the biggest local creators to have a field day with these supercars. Let's have some fun. They're going so fast. And this is just the first of many experiences we're going to be doing here. We are just getting started. I'm ready to race. Oh, we're about to laps on. We're catching up to them. Oh, no, Jimmy. No, no. Come on, grandma. I don't think my mom will be happy watching you. I don't think she can drive slower if she wanted to. That's illegal. OK, that's like, like, that's really illegal. Well, my friends, and I were pretending to be race car drivers. Carl was getting ready to drive an actual formula-level race car. I look so cool now. Let's do this thing. Off to a rocky start. No! Oh! Oh my god, I'm driving a formula car. This is the best day of my life. For the price of this experience, we actually got to keep this a brand-new liver heating. I want to enjoy the little bit. In case you're curious, this fanboy is fast. Let's go do an NBA game all the way in Abu Dhabi. But to be honest, guys, I'm not the kind of guy who likes to drive around sports cars. And plus, we cannot find a parking spot. So, I'm just going to find someone to get this thing too. Do any of you watch the Mr. Beast channel? Yeah. That's of subscribe. Can I just give you this Lamborghini? I prefer someone else's. What? What the heck just happened? Hey, sir, security, can you come over? Oh, he's subscribed. Can I just give you this Lambo? Yeah, please. All right, get in. This is officially your Lamborghini. I'm actually shaking my head. That's why you got to make sure you're subscribed. I'd hate for you to lose a Lamborghini. Hey, boys, what are you doing? We got quartzite tickets. Enjoy. That's so heavy. With the Lamborghini now off my hands, I got to stick quartzite at a pro-passable game. But instead, it just ended up turning into a photo shoot. Then afterwards, I said hi to Steve Harvey. And after that, Russell Westbrook. And with $200,000 worth of experiences left to do, up next, we got to take over a massive water park. Somehow, in the middle of the desert, hang out with penguins. I heard you're the alpha. That is an alpha thing to do. And since that wasn't enough, I am now in a gyple with 80 charts in Steve's race. Hello, there, sir. Hey, hey, come back here. I was trying to talk to you. It's like Buzz Lightyear. Whoa! Excuse me, sir. Yo, we got some pool. I am Aquaman, the king of the sharks. My first decree is the sharks by him and not me. Agreed? Oh, attack him. Attack him. I am your leader. Attack him. That should not exist. I think it is. I'm bloodmarked.
