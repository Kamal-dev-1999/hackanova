 Let's grab some steak after work. Can't. Got something to do. Mm-hmm. What is it? Gotta go to driving school. Didn't you fail for two years? And the school even refunded your money? Fine. I have to spend time with my girlfriend. Didn't she dump you a month ago? Alright. Alright. I'm actually working as a delivery guy. Didn't your motorbike get stolen last week? Ugh. Fine. I'm broke. Okay. You really had to make me say it? Let's go out and have some fun later. Nah. It's my girlfriend's birthday today. Are you out of your mind? Why does an inflatable doll need a birthday? She has a manufacturing date too.
