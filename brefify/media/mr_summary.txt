 In this video, you will find out why it costs a quarter of a million dollars to simulate going to space . For $10,000, you can go 3,000 feet in the sky, with a chef who uses this hot air balloon as her kitchen . In the next video, Tariq and Nolan are also on a $50,000 safari in Africa .
 This is the craziest view of ever. Unlike any spectacle seen before in the history of mankind, my friends and I are about to see what half of million dollars can allow you to experience in the most luxurious, much-trapless in the entire world, the city of DuPai . And at the end of this video, I'm going to become one of the few individuals in history to stand on top of the tallest building in the world .
 This is just the first of many experiences we're going to be doing in Dubai . We got to stick quartzite at a pro-passable game and hang out with penguins in the desert . With $200,000 worth of experiences left to do, up next, we got to take over a massive water park .
