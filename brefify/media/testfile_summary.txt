 Andre explains how to implement responsive UI in Streamlit application . Andre says that Streamlit's out of the box UI, it renders very well in responsive way . But what I'll be talking today is your own components that you add to the screen . And based on vertical space, which is available, I want to calculate how many columns should be rendered, like four columns, three, two, or maybe one, if we're displaying our application on a mobile device .
 Render form wide creates four streamed columns and we are feeling the first column, then second, third and fourth . And if it's average size, you know, I then we are using three columns. If it's narrow to and if you are on the mobile, when . when horizontal space is limited, so basically one column. And by the way, this . application is using nested columns out of the box. This functionality is not available in stream, you can render only one layer of columns and you cannot have another set of columns inside the first layer .
